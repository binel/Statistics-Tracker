        <h1>What is ISU Statitics Tracker?</h1>
        <p>
            ISU Statistics Tracker is a web aplication designed to dynamically show the breakdown of enrollment information based college, major, gender, race, and origin. The charts and maps generated are dynamically created using D3.js and can be interacted with by the user.
            <br><br>
            The general page will focus on the six colleges of ISU excluding VET MED as it is a graduate only program. General will show the number of undergraduate students, gender split, and ethnic deversity per college. There is also a US map showing the number of students attending ISU per state.
            <br><br>
            Each college will have the same breakdown of information only focussing on their particular majors. For ease of use and to better represent the data, the charts can be easily sorted with the given options and additional data associated with each data point can be viewed by hovering over the point of interest.
        </p>

        <h1>Navigation</h1>
        <p>
            To navigate the application, there is a navbar splitting up the site into general information (which focusses on ISU as a whole), each collge, and international attendance. Clicking on the college name will take you to that college's page showing the information for their majors. Each page also has a side bar that will take you to a particular chart on the page.

            Advanced users may find it interesting to note that clicking on the data for a college on the general page's charts will redirect the browser to the page of the proper college.
